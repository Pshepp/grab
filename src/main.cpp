 * @date 01 Mar 2021
 * @brief A quick driver to test our graph class.
 *
 * We are ensuring the following work:
 * 	- Node deletion
 * 	- Node addition
 *
 * 	TODO:
 * 			- Create a "helper" class/functions that will create our adj matricies/adj lists
 * 				in order to ensure our data is being manipulated correctly.
 * 			- Take Olivers abstraction of lists etc. We will probably want to do some nonfunctional
 * 				reqs with the bio nerds to make sure we abstract all data that they will want between
 * 				classes
 * 			- Implement our nodes being owned by a graph structure.
 * 			- FIX SET INDEX!! Proper index tracking for all of our nodes and edges
